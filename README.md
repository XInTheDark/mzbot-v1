# mzbot-v2

MZ Bot v2 for Discord, built with Python!

**This repository is owned and actively maintained by XInTheDark (aka Muzhen Gaming).**

First created on 25 August 2021, the bot now has a huge variety of commands in a number of categories (e.g. utility,
moderation, message processing, entertainment, music, etc.)

*Note: This project has been made open source a while ago. The source code is now openly available to any interested
persons.
We welcome all pull requests and issues.*

This commit is merely to test the new 'Actions' system. If the system proves to be unreliable, then remove it.
