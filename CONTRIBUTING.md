# MZ Bot contributing guide

Here at the MZ Bot project, all contributions are welcomed, including
Pull Requests (PRs) and Issues (such as bug reports or new ideas). If your contributions are accepted, your
changes will be added to the bot.

Here are some tips and guidelines to get you started.

## Getting started

1. Please follow the [GitHub Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct)
and [GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)
at all times. Remember, treat everyone with respect, be open-minded, and contribute constructively.
2. It's a good idea to take a look at the bot's code before contributing your own code. For example, [main.py](main.py) contains
most of the functional code, and each function in the code represents a different command.
The code has been written to make it easy for beginners to contribute; however, if there are some parts that you don't understand, feel free to
ask questions in the Issues section.
3. It's also useful to read the [Discord.py documentation (API Reference)](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)
to get an idea of how the Discord.py library works. The documentation is written in a very concise and readable manner, 
so understanding it should be easy.

## Code contributions

For a start, all pull requests are welcomed. For example, if you have found a bug in the code, you can fix it and 
[open a pull request](https://github.com/XInTheDark/mzbot-v2/compare) directly.
Alternatively, if you have a good idea and want to add new functionality to the bot, that's also fine.

Or, if you don't have an idea right now, you can 
[take a look at the open issues](https://github.com/XInTheDark/mzbot-v2/issues)
and try to resolve them.

Finally, you can take a look at the open PRs and add your comments to improve them.

## Issues

Don't know how to code? That's okay. If you see a bug, or want to add a new idea, you can 
[create an issue](https://github.com/XInTheDark/mzbot-v2/issues/new), and we will look into it.

## That's all. Thank you for contributing to MZ Bot!
